Ace v4.0.0
---

Thank you for purchasing Ace admin template.  

To view the demo, you can open `index.html`. Basic 3rd party files required for demo are included inside `node_modules`.  

However for full functionality and to customize CSS and JS files, you should run `npm install` to install required tools, libraries, frameworks, etc...  

You may also need to install `git` if you see an error like this:  
```
npm ERR! code ENOENT
npm ERR! syscall spawn git
```


Then you can:  
- Run `node index.js` and then open `http://localhost:8081/`
- Or use a custom port number. For example, run `PORT=8000 node index.js` and then open `http://localhost:8000/`
- Or open `index.html`

*Make sure* to build a custom **ace.css** as described in docs to remove unwanted features and have a smaller file.
